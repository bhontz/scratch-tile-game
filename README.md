# scratch-tile-game
STEM training exercise - See Scratch (scratch.mit.edu) Project "Tile Game Brad Head"

STEM leaders / mentors interested in creating a "learning workshop" using this project should examine the Powerpoint deck included within this repository, GSOC-TileGameWorkshop-CurriculumForLeaders-201704.pptx.

**OPTIONAL BONUS STEP FOR THIS WORKSHOP** This repository contains a python script that will split a 4:3 aspect image into 9 160x120px files that will be used as sprites within this Scratch project's tile game.  The objective is to have class participants take a photo of their face with their iPhone (portrait image is 4:3) as the basis for the class.  Note that this script requires the [python pillow](https://python-pillow.org) module.

I have included example images within the images folder of this repo, including a "blank image" (TILE-BLANK.jpg) which can be used as the tile game's space. Leaders can conduct this workshop using the images found within this folder, without the need to utilize the optional python script noted above.
