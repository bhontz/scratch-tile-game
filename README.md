# scratch-tile-game
STEM training exercise - See Scratch (scratch.mit.edu) Project "Tile Game Brad Head"

This repository contains a python script that will split a 4:3 aspect image into 9 160x120px files that will be used as sprites within this Scratch project's tile game.  The objective is to have class participants take a photo of their face with their iPhone (portrait image is 4:3) as the basis for the class.  

Note that this script requires the [python pillow](https://python-pillow.org) module.

I have included example images within the images folder, including a "blank image" (TILE-BLANK.jpg) which can be used as the tile game's space.
